This is another Frontend Mentor challenge project in which I've practiced my JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills.
In this project I've used REST countries API from which I've fetched countries and shown them on the page.
When user clicks on the country flag, another page is displayed. On that page user can see a little bit more information
about specific country.
User can also search for specific country.
